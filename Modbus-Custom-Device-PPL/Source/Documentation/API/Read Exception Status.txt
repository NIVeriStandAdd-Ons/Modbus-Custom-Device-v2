<desc><para>Interface to reads any exception status set in the device. The exeption status is a set of 8 status bits, packed as a U8 integer. With third-party devices, this function should only be used if the device is a serial device, as the Modbus specification defines this as a serial-only function. However, this library includes support for this function regardless of the transport mechanism.</para>
